```ruby
ARN: Unresolved specs during Gem::Specification.reset:
      rb-inotify (>= 0.9.7, ~> 0.9)
WARN: Clearing out unresolved specs.
Please report a bug if this causes problems.
```

It's because there are multiple version of the package and jekyll doesn't know which one to use.

```ruby
gem cleanup rb-inotify
```
