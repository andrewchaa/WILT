# Things to do to set up a new project

These are the things I do when I create a new C# serverless project that would be deployed to AWS

- [ ] Create a serverless project
- [ ] Create an empty solution and add the project to it
- [ ] Create a Github repo
- [ ] Create a Github action to deploy the project to AWS
