# Writing down the process of a given work

I find it easier to follow written process or steps to do. It seems to take less energy to follow instructions. 

So I started writing down what to do in a given situation.
The first example is when I start my work in the morning

### Starting the work day

* Check Teams messages. 
* Check email and my meetings on calendar
* Write down things to do for the day on my personal backlog
